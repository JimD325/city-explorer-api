Time Estimates
For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

Name of feature: Weather and Movie data for searched city. 

Estimate of time needed to complete: 4 hours

Start time: 12pm

Finish time: 930pm

Actual time needed to complete: 9.5 hours, however about 4 of those were spent trying to get it to deploy properly to heroku.
